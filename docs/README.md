# Google Catalog Import

This app allows VTEX Catalog data to be imported from a spreadsheet on a user's Google Drive.

## Configuration

1. [Install](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) `vtex.sheets-catalog-import` in the desired account.

2. In your account's admin dashboard, go to `Catalog > Google Catalog Import`.

3. Follow the instructions provided on the admin page to grant access to your Google Drive.

## Notes

A Google Drive account may only be used on one site at a time.
Using the app on multiple sites by the same user would requires the user to either
 - Use a different Google account (email address) for each site.
 - Only log in to a single site at a time.
